# refactoring-ui-color-palette

This project is based on the [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com) preview,
[Building your color palette](https://www.refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette).

**Disclaimer**: I am in no way affiliated with refactoring ui. I've applied their technique and created a tool to easily create a color palette.

## Use

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm start
```

Then access the page at https://localhost:8080.
