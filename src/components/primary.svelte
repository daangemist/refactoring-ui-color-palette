<h2 class="subtitle">Primary color</h2>
<p>
  Most sites need one, maybe two colors that are used for primary actions, emphasizing navigation elements, etc. These
  are the colors that determine the overall look of a site â€” the ones that make you think of Facebook as "blue", even
  though it's really mostly grey.

<Color storeColor={primary} />
